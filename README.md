Created without AI

Requirements: Python 3 with the tkinter library

Created on my own utilizing doubly-linked lists, which I also implemented myself.
Supports addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/), as well as allowing the minus and plus signs to be used for negative/positive numbers. 
Now supports parentheses (), as well as multiplication by placing a number or expression next to another number or expression in parentheses.

I heard making a calculator was a pretty standard practice for those learning computer science. I was not aware that it would be this hard. (still fun though)

To do: Add robust error handling, exponents, and modulo.
